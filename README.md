# forcedomain

forcedomain is a middleware for Connect and Express that redirects any request to a default domain, e.g. to redirect to either the www or the non-www version of a domain.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install forcedomain
```

## Quick start

The first thing you need to do is to integrate forcedomain into your application. For that add a reference to the `forcedomain` module.

```javascript
const forceDomain = require('forcedomain');
```

If you now want to redirect your requests to a specific host, include the middleware and configure it accordingly.

```javascript
app.use(forceDomain({
  hostname: 'www.example.com'
}));
```

Additionally, you can also specify a port and a target protocol.

```javascript
app.use(forceDomain({
  hostname: 'www.example.com',
  port: 4000,
  protocol: 'https'
}));
```

By default, forcedomain redirects using `permanent` request. This is generally considered best practice with respect to SEO, as it tells search engines that there is a single long-term canonical address for a ressource.

If you want to use a `temporary` redirect instead, specify it as redirection type.

```javascript
app.use(forceDomain({
  hostname: 'www.example.com',
  type: 'temporary'
}));
```

You can use `excludeRule` to disable redirect based on a regular expression.

```javascript
app.use(forceDomain({
  hostname: 'www.example.com',
  excludeRule: /[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.herokuapp\.com/i
}));
```

*Please note that `localhost` and local IPs (`127.0.0.1`, `192.168.x.x`) are always being excluded from redirection. Hence you can continue developing locally as you are used to.*

### Using a reverse-proxy

If you are running your web application behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx, you have to forward the originally requested host.

```
server {
  // ...

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  }
}
```
